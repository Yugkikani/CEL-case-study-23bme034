⚗️ Chemical Reaction Equilibrium Case Study
Author: Yug Kikani
Course: Engineering Mathematics / Numerical Methods
Tool Used: MATLAB
🔷 1. Project Overview
This case study models the chemical equilibrium of a reaction system by solving a set of nonlinear algebraic equations representing equilibrium concentrations.
The objective is to:
Formulate equilibrium relations using thermodynamic principles
Develop nonlinear equations from equilibrium constants
Solve the system numerically using MATLAB
Interpret physical and chemical meaning of results
🔷 2. Problem Description
Consider a reversible reaction system:
In chemical systems:
Reactants convert into products
The reaction proceeds until equilibrium is reached
At equilibrium, concentrations satisfy the equilibrium constant relation
Because equilibrium expressions involve powers and products of concentrations, the resulting equations are nonlinear.
